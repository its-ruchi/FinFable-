    author: "Warren Buffett",
    content:
      "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it. Compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe. It is the concept of adding interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest. It makes a sum of money grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount. This concept is central to saving and investing, and understanding it can greatly impact your financial future.",
